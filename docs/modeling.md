# Modeling


## Modeling Guidelines
* Models can be exported as *.bpmn and *.svg files.
* Selecting the individual elements displays the selected element's properties and allows the user to change them.
* To specify potential evidence stored in evidence store, a user must select them in the data store properties in the sidebar.
* To mark a task as integrity or authenticity computation, or data transfer, the task must have at least one input and one output being a potential evidence object.

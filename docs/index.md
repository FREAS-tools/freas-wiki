# Quick Guide

FREAS is a modeling and analysis tool for forensic-ready software systems. The tool allows users to import or model business processes using the BPMN for Forensic-Ready Systems (BPMN4FRSS) notation. On the provided BPMN4FRSS model, users can run different types of analysis to evaluate the extent to which the modeled system complies with forensic readiness requirements. Furthermore, users can assess the system's ability to provide evidence with high evidentiary value in case of an incident. 

As a result, the tool allows users to inspect the possible model insufficiencies and offers hints to remedy the issue.

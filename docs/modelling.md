# Modelling

The toolbox on the left contains BPMN and BPMN4FRSS elements that can be placed into the canvas. Then, the elements can be modified using a contextual pad (available when selected) or the properties panel on the right. Connections between the elements can be drawn using the tools from the contextual pad. Properties of the element can be edited using the properties panel.

## Modelling Guidelines
* Models can be exported as *.bpmn and *.svg files.
* Selecting the individual elements displays the selected element's properties and allows the user to change them.
* To specify potential evidence stored in evidence store, a user must select them in the data store properties in the sidebar.
* To mark a task as integrity or authenticity computation, or data transfer, the task must have at least one input and one output being a potential evidence object.
